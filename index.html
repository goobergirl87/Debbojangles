                <p class="posttext">Who is <b>Debbo Jangles</b>? Debbojangles - short for Deborah Jangles - is the working title of this website. My name in a parallel universe, where I am an entertainer juggling with meatballs, ending every show by throwing them up in the air and letting them slide into my belly without chewing. Like that or similar. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">Of course having my own website is not so crazy of an idea, also having a <b>blog</b> seems a bit outdated. But using all my new skills and applying them to my own website is undeniably a good idea. I was very happy to actually transfer the Etch-a-sketch knowledge into my scratch-pad-portrait and of course getting to use Flexbox again. So this website will dynamically change and adapt to everything I learn. So if something looks crooked, especially in the mobile version, it’s cause I’m learning.</p>    
                <p class="posttext">For those wondering about my previous work, my photos and my designs. I will use my new skills to put my art projects in the right light but in a later point in my journey. For now this website will be focused on the coding. And on making cute adds for the side bar.  </p>    
                <p class="posttext"><b>Warning!</b> Depending on your device or your screen size this website might look super crooked. Keep in mind, I'm still learning. Responsiveness was not yet on the schedule. But still I'm always happy for feedback!</p>

                <p class="posttext">Compared to the previous game Etch-a-sketch felt on one side easy, but on the other also not. But besides facing new problems, I had the feeling that the gained knowledge had sunken deeper into my braincells. I was starting to go to bed thinking about how to solve a problem and waking up with ideas. The main focus of this project lies on <b>DOM manipulation</b>. Staying focused and mapping out the problems is still my biggest challenge. And writing that down is actually also helpful itself. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">The combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript tickled me again in the most satisfying way. I know I’m far away from being a professional coder, but this project was just a delight. Moving on to the last JavaScript Fundamentals.</p>    
                <p class="posttext">Edited: I wrote all the past posts at once. Since I committed now seriously to becoming a web developer (93% of the foundations course feels like committing), I wanted to document my journey - for myself, future employers, people who are also teaching themselves how to code or who want to do that.</p>
