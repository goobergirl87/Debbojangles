                <p class="posttext">Who is <b>Debbo Jangles</b>? Debbojangles - short for Deborah Jangles - is the working title of this website. My name in a parallel universe, where I am an entertainer juggling with meatballs, ending every show by throwing them up in the air and letting them slide into my belly without chewing. Like that or similar. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">Of course having my own website is not so crazy of an idea, also having a <b>blog</b> seems a bit outdated. But using all my new skills and applying them to my own website is undeniably a good idea. I was very happy to actually transfer the Etch-a-sketch knowledge into my scratch-pad-portrait and of course getting to use Flexbox again. So this website will dynamically change and adapt to everything I learn. So if something looks crooked, especially in the mobile version, it’s cause I’m learning.</p>    
                <p class="posttext">For those wondering about my previous work, my photos and my designs. I will use my new skills to put my art projects in the right light but in a later point in my journey. For now this website will be focused on the coding. And on making cute adds for the side bar.  </p>    
                <p class="posttext"><b>Warning!</b> Depending on your device or your screen size this website might look super crooked. Keep in mind, I'm still learning. Responsiveness was not yet on the schedule. But still I'm always happy for feedback!</p>

                <p class="posttext">Compared to the previous game Etch-a-sketch felt on one side easy, but on the other also not. But besides facing new problems, I had the feeling that the gained knowledge had sunken deeper into my braincells. I was starting to go to bed thinking about how to solve a problem and waking up with ideas. The main focus of this project lies on <b>DOM manipulation</b>. Staying focused and mapping out the problems is still my biggest challenge. And writing that down is actually also helpful itself. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">The combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript tickled me again in the most satisfying way. I know I’m far away from being a professional coder, but this project was just a delight. Moving on to the last JavaScript Fundamentals.</p>    
                <p class="posttext">Edited: I wrote all the past posts at once. Since I committed now seriously to becoming a web developer (93% of the foundations course feels like committing), I wanted to document my journey - for myself, future employers, people who are also teaching themselves how to code or who want to do that.</p>

                <p class="posttext">So far Rock, paper, scissors was the highest mountain to climb. I mentioned earlier that TOP provides a lot of reading resources, so fighting through all the JavaScript Fundamentals to get to the next project was a challenge. So far the journey felt quite easy but now I had reached a point, where I needed to show myself, if I really wanted to keep on going. The curriculum provides besides the plain knowledge also really helpful resources on <b>problem-solving, writing clean code and understanding errors</b>. Also they make very clear at the beginning that there’ll be ups and downs. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">I started the project with a lot of enthusiasm, but got stuck very soon. My main issue was, that I wanted to solve too many problems at once or that I was not able to point out the different problems at all. <b>Coding can be overwhelming, not knowing where to start.</b> TOPs section on writing pseudocode was a huge help and put me on the right path again. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">As soon I was done with the plain console game, TOP send me through the DOM manipulation topic, so I could start with the graphical user interface. Besides learning on how to create elements and addEventListeners via JavaScript, I also learned about branching in Git. Making the GUI and seeing it come to life was a <b>wholesome experience</b> for that project. So who wants to play a round?!</p>

                <p class="posttext">After finishing the CSS foundations section and the topic Flexbox, I entered the second project. A webpage that actually had the potential to be on the live web compared to my early recipes page. This time TOP gave an example how the page should look like, and how it should behave. You get encouraged to google your way through the process, if you’re stuck. And don’t you dare, look up other’s students solutions! <b>Flexbox</b> can be challenging, but once I got the concept and once I’ve read that it was the savior after spending hours with grid, to produce a similar end result, my gratitude rose. This project was a great teacher in learning the making of a classical layout and repetitive structures on the web. </p>

                <p class="posttext">So the fun begins. The first project in the curriculum was to create a simple website with HTML. Since I already attempted making websites from scratch not everything was new to me. Still it was very helpful and necessary, to start from the very beginning. I got introduced to <b>Git</b> and its value in a work environment. Later in the curriculum the webpage is added by some CSS. My main problems at that stage were to find the right gif. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">Seeing my code coming to life, gives me flashbacks of the early 2000s when my parents bought the first computer. Hearing the modem sound and opening the browser was pure magic and building webpages on my own now, feels like entering this mysterious world. </p>

                <p class="posttext">TOP is my educational source of choice. It’s an open source project and it has a kind and helpful community behind it. The members put lots of effort in it to create a huge curriculum, which is constantly being improved. According to other self-taught students TOP is quite text-heavy and has the very important style of not giving clear instructions. Meaning while you’re doing a project nobody takes you by the hand and walks you through the process. The main thought behind it, is to give you all the resources and knowledge on a plate, but you have to apply them yourself. This can often lead to loose your mind, but the reward of finding a solution is indescribable.  </p>

                <p class="posttext">So to be honest, I changed this paragraph several times. My professional path hasn’t been so linear. But there is no time and no real reason to regret. To learn how to code was always in the back of my head. I tried it in different ways, but somehow it wouldn’t stick. But the happier I am now, that I found a way to stick to it. Sometimes you have the feeling, that something is right for you, but it’s not working out. </p>    
                <p class="posttext">This might sound trivial, but I always wanted to do classical ballet. Same story, tried it many times since I was 15, the spark was not there. Then suddenly 6 years ago, it came. I loved the teachers, the style, the people, the surroundings and the dance itself. I’m sticking to it and can’t imagine not doing ballet. So it feels the same. </p> 
                <p class="posttext">With the right environment - thanks to The Odin Project - I was able to find my coding spark. The spark doesn’t guarantee that it’s easy, the learning process is a mixture of doubts and dopamine hits. But that’s how it is, the more you love something, the more you invest and work. </p>
